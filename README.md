# CNN-Image-Classification
This contains code for various curiosity-quenching models that were implemented because of wanting to understand the nature and behaviour of Neural Nets. 

Models implemented for Image Classification out of wanting to understand the working of RNNs:

1. RNN LSTM on Image Pixels, one row at a time
2. RNN LSTM on Global Image features: Col Histogram  and gist512, one row at a time.
3. RNN LSTM on Local Image features, one row at a time as sequential input.
